### Performance Analysis

![](img/A1.jpg)

From the figure we can see that forward+ and clustered deferred can improve performance, and as the total number of lights increases, the performance improvement becomes more obvious

**2-component normals**

According to the chart, 2-component normal does not improve performance to a large extent. I think the reason may be that although 2-component normal optimizes the use of G-Buffer and reduces its space, it also adds additional computational overhead.
