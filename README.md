### Performance Analysis:

The Forward Plus Renderer fram rate varied drastically with a frame rate in between 90 and 110 for close up scenes that do not show much geometry to frame rates in between 38 and 57 for far away scenes that show a lot of the scene.

The Cluster Deferred Renderer performed slightly worse in the far away scene with a frame rate in between 47 and 50 while th eclose up scene varied widely from the 50s ro the 90s in frame rate.

It's hard to say what caused the difference in performance especially because my clustered deferred renderer is not correct or complete.

No new features added.
